# DevOps

As a **business analyst turned AI/software development enthusiast**, Iâ€™ve created this space to document my learning journey and share my insights.  
- **Scope**: This repository covers foundational concepts, real-world case analysis, pitfalls (and how to avoid them!), plus explorations of emerging technologies.  
- **Update Frequency**: Expect **3 or more** updates every week to keep the content fresh and evolving.  
- **Goal**: It serves as both a personal note-taking archive and a place for anyone interested in tech to find inspiration or guidance.

Join me on this exciting path of continuous discovery and growth! ðŸš€ðŸ¤–âœ¨
